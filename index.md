Hello! I'm Alexandros Kornilakis, a software engineer from Greece with a passion for web development, cybersecurity, and AI. With over five years of work experience, I specialize in building web applications, browser extensions, mobile apps, and security tools.
</br>
I have a deep understanding of web technologies, browser internals, and virtual machines, working with languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Python, and Java. My expertise spans React.js, Astro, Next.js, as well as backend technologies such as Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, and GraphQL.
</br>
Currently, I am a Software Engineer at ICS-FORTH, where I develop web applications, and contribute to internet measurement research projects. Previously, I have worked on projects involving fake news detection, penetration testing, and synthetic vulnerability research, collaborating with companies like Google and F-Secure.
</br>
I enjoy learning new technologies, optimizing software performance, and solving security challenges. Feel free to check out my GitHub, research papers, and projects to learn more about my work.
